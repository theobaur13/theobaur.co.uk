# theobaur.co.uk (Legacy)

**This repository contains the source code for the legacy version of my personal website.**  
The live version of my website has been moved to a new repository, which you can find [here](https://github.com/theobaur13/theobaur.co.uk-flask).

## About
My evolving personal website source code. 

This was a simple static website deployed using _Netlify_ designed to showcase my current and upcoming projects . This website uses my own custom CSS stylesheet and JavaScript to display animations. Feel free to use any part of this website for personal or public use.

As of now, this repository is no longer actively maintained. For the latest version of my site, please visit the [new repository](https://github.com/theobaur13/theobaur.co.uk-flask).

## Live Site
The live, updated version of my website can be found at [theobaur.co.uk](https://theobaur.co.uk).

## Legacy Site
Feel free to explore or fork this code for personal use. Keep in mind this version may be outdated compared to the live version.
You can explore my old site at [theobaur-legacy.netlify.app](https://theobaur-legacy.netlify.app/)
